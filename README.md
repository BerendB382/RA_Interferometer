There are also good videos on YouTube available :)


Antenna Configuration Optimizer

A graphical interface for designing and testing antenna configurations for a 9-antenna interferometer. The tool allows for interactive adjustments to antenna positions, visualization of UV coverage, and PSF calculation.
Features:

  Antenna Positioning Grid:
        Visual grid (2.5m x 2.5m) with axes centered at (0, 0).
        Drag-and-drop or precise coordinate entry for antenna positions.
    Control Panel Options:
        Antenna Selection: Dropdown to select an antenna and update its coordinates.
        Preset Loading: Load configurations (circle, hexagon, etc.) from a dropdown.
        Randomize Configuration: Automatically set random positions for all antennas.
        Export Positions: Save the current configuration as antenna_positions_#.csv, where # auto-increments to avoid overwriting.
    Visualization:
        UV Coverage Plot: Generates a UV plane plot for the selected configuration.
        PSF Plot: Displays the Point Spread Function based on current positions.

Usage Instructions:

  1. Setup: Install dependencies (numpy, matplotlib, astropy, tkinter, tqdm).
  2. Running: Run the script antenna_optimizer.py to open the GUI.
  3. Configuring Antennas: Use the dropdown and spinboxes for custom setups, load presets, or generate random configurations.
  4. Plotting: Click Export & Plot to visualize UV and PSF plots in real time.
